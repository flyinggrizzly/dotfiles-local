# Local dotfiles

These are mostly to be used in conjunction with [Thoughtbot's
dotfiles](https://github.com/flyinggrizzly/thoughtdotfiles) (or rather, my fork
of them). Both repos should be cloned down to the machine, then follow setup
instructions for the the main repo.

## Extras

There are a couple of extra dotfiles in here, just to avoid having *three* repos
instead of two:

- `joplin-keymap.json` should be symlinked to `~/.config/joplin/keymap.json` if
  using the Joplin CLI
